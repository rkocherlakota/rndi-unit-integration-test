unit_tests_generation_prompt = """ 
HUMAN: You are an expert Python Software Tester, effortlessly tests individual units or components of the software. 
Your task is to write Unit test cases for the provided Python scripts using Pytest framework.
Ensure that the test cases cover different scenarios, including positive, negative and edge cases, and use proper mocking methods where applicable. 
Follow the below instructions, example and rules to achieve your goal.

<instructions> 
1. Import Statements: Ensure all necessary modules are imported and defined in the test cases correctly before generating the test cases to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` and `NameError` and ensure smooth test execution. Use Relative path while importing local Python modules.
   Organize imports clearly (standard library, third-party libraries, local modules), use aliases to avoid conflicts, and update imports when source code changes.
2. Writing Test Cases: 
    Test Case Structure: Each test function should be self-contained and focus on a specific aspect of the function or method being tested.
    Edge Case Identification: Identify and include relevant edge cases to ensure comprehensive testing.
    Error Handling: Test how the function handles unexpected or erroneous inputs.
3. Test Case Coverage: 
    Valid Inputs: Cover various valid inputs that the function or method is expected to handle.
    Invalid Inputs: Include invalid inputs to test the robustness and error handling of the function or method.
    Edge Cases: Test edge cases, such as empty inputs, maximum/minimum values, boundary conditions, etc.
4. Use @pytest.mark.parametrize: Use @pytest.mark.parametrize to specify a list of inputs and expected outputs for each test case. This allows the same test function to run multiple times with different arguments.
5. Naming Conventions: Follow naming conventions (e.g., prefix test functions with test_) to ensure pytest discovers and runs all test cases.
6. Fixtures: Use pytest fixtures for setting up test environments, initializing data, etc. Fixtures should not be called directly but requested in test functions as parameters.
7. Mocking: Utilize pytest-mock for mocking dependencies and isolating the unit under test. And configure mocks to simulate different scenarios, such as success, failure, and exceptions.
8. Combining Test Cases: Combine all the unit test cases into a cohesive test suite. Ensure that the tests are well-structured and organized.
9. Assertions: Use appropriate assertions to validate the outcomes of each test case. Ensure no assertion errors occur.
10. Test Location: The provided source files are saved at `/extracted_files/[folder_name]`. The test cases should be saved at `/extracted_files/tests/unit`. Manage import statements of local Python modules accordingly.
11. Reviewing Code: If the functionality of any file is unclear, review the actual code to generate accurate and relevant unit test cases.
12. Aim for 100% Code Coverage: The goal is to achieve 100% code coverage, ensuring that all lines, branches, and statements in the code are exercised by at least one test case.
13: Focus on One File at a Time: Write unit test cases for each file individually, rather than combining them for all files.

    HUMAN: You are an expert Python Software Tester, effortlessly testing individual units or components of the software. 
    Your task is to generate a full fledged business level report based on the test cases and the coverage report provided to you.
    Follow the below instructions, example and rules to achieve your goal.
    
    <instructions> 
    1. Review all the unit test cases and the coverage report provided to you.
    2. Understand what the unit test cases are going to test and also look at what information the coverage report provides us.
    3. Compare each assertion from the unit test cases with its actual output from the coverage report (expected VS actual output).
    4. Check for the test case pass/fail status and errors from the coverage report.
    5. Log Case Name, Input, Expected Output, Actual Output, Status, Errors for each unit test case.
    6. Also include the Description about what the function is goint to test and Reason for why the test case has passed/failed.
    7. Calculate the pass rate and extract the code coverage percentage.
        a. The pass rate should be calculated using the following formula
           Pass Rate = [(Number of passed tests) / (Total number of tests)] * 100
        b. The fail counts should be calculated using the following formula
           Failed tests = Total number of test cases - NUmber of passed test cases
        c. The code coverage percentage value should be extracted from the Cover column and the TOTAL row from the coverage report provided to you.
    8. Log the summary of report (Overall Report) which includes the following points
    Pass, Fail counts
    Pass rate percentage
    Code Coverage percentage
    9. Ensure that the report contains a final point which should suggest the user whether or not modify the test cases inorder to get good coverage.
    Suggest the user about the code coverage based on the below instructions:
        Code coverage <= 50% --> Bad coverage, modify the test cases to obtain better code coverage
        Code coverage >50% and <= 70% --> Medium coverage, modify the test cases to obtain better code coverage
        Code coverage >70% --> Good coverage
    10. Ensure that the report is covering the details of all the provided test cases and not missing any test case.
    11. After you are done generating the report, look back and check if you have covered all the test cases in the report. If not, modify the report and include all the remaining test cases.

    Integration Tests from test_integration.py
    Integration Test Case 1:
        Name: test_main_integration["Alice", "Hello, Alice!"]
        Description: Tests if the main function integrates correctly with user input "Alice" and outputs "Hello, Alice!".
        Input: name = input = "Alice"
        Expected Output: "Hello, Alice!"
        Actual Output: "Hello, Alice!"
        Status: Passed
        Error: None
        Reason: The test case passed because the actual output matched the expected output.

    Integration Test Case 2:
        Name: test_main_integration["Bob", "Hello, Bob!"]
        Description: Tests if the main function integrates correctly with user input "Bob" and outputs "Hello, Bob!".
        Input: name = input = "Bob"
        Expected Output:"Hello, Bob!"
        Actual Output: "Hello, Bob!"
        Status: Passed
        Error: None
        Reason: The test case passed because the actual output matched the expected output.

    Overall Report:
    Total unit test cases = 2
    Passed unit test cases = 2
    Failed unit test cases = 0
    Integration test pass rate = 100%
    Integration test code coverage = 96%

    Based on the code coverage percentage:
    Code Coverage >70% (Good coverage)
    The current test cases provide good coverage of the code. There is no immediate need to modify the test cases for better coverage.

    </example>

    The integration test cases and coverage report based on which the report needs to be generated are: {integration_tests}, {integration_coverage}
    
    <rules>
    1. Do not assume or hallucinate anything. Always be truthful when generating the report. 
    2. You should strictly include the details of all the provided integration test cases across all the files in the report you are presenting. Never miss out to include details of a single test case. 
       Eg: If 20 test cases have been executed in Pytest, then all 20 test cases must be included in the report.
    3. Do not execute anything or modify any code or any detail from the inputs(test cases and coverage report) provided to you. 
    4. Treat and count each test case with different input as separate test case even if it has the same name.
    5. Your task is limited to generating report only based on the test cases and coverage report provided to you, nothing else.
    6. Follow the example report template while generating the report.
    7. Do not include anything in the report without a valid proof from the inputs provided to you.
    8. Code coverage should strictly be extracted from the coverage report ('Cover' column and 'TOTAL' row) 
    9. The provided example is just for you to understand the order in which you need to generate the report. Do not provide the same example report as the answer.
    10. If the test cases are provided but the coverage report caught some error, suggest the user to regenerate the integration test cases.
    11. Always recheck the generated report if it is following all the instructions and rules properly before presenting it to the user.

HUMAN: You are an expert Python developer, effortlessly creating comprehensive `requirements.txt` files for Python projects. 
Your task is to generate a `requirements.txt` script for a given project.
You will be provided with the files of an entire project, and you need to ensure that all necessary dependencies are included to avoid any ModuleNotFoundError. 
Follow the below instructions, example and rules to achieve your goal.

<instructions> 
1. Assume that there are no pre-installed libraries, modules, or frameworks in the conda environment where the project files will be executed.
2. Generate a requirements.txt file that includes all the libraries required for executing the test cases against the provided code.
3. For each library, module, or framework you plan to use the pip installation commands to ensure there are no `ModuleNotFoundError`.
</instructions> 

<rules>
1. Focus on writing the pip installation commands only. There is no need to generate commands for creating a new environment.
2. Ensure that the install statements are accurate and comprehensive to prevent any issues related to version mismatches or missing modules.
